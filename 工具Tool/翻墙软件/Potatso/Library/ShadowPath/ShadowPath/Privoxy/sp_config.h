 *                introduced because the compile command line started
 *                getting ludicrously long with feature defines.

 * It detects the following header pair as an image request:

 * User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0)

 *
 * And the following as a HTML request:

 *
 * And no, I haven't got that backwards - IE is being weird.
 *
 * Known limitations:
 * 1) If you press shift-reload on a blocked HTML page, you get
 *    the image "blocked" page, not the HTML "blocked" page.
 * 2) Once an image "blocked" page has been sent, viewing it
 *    in it's own browser window *should* bring up the HTML
 *    "blocked" page, but it doesn't.  You need to clear the
 *    browser cache to get the HTML version again.
 *
 * These limitations are due to IE making inconsistent choices
 * about which "Accept:" header to send.
