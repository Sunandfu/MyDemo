## Project Info

Potatso has in total 26 dependencies as following

* 20 Cocoapod dependencies
* 4 submodules dependencies via local cocoapod

The project is tested with Xcode `9.4 (9F1027a)` on iOS `11.4 (15F79)` device with cocoapod version `1.4.0`+.  
If you experienced an expected issue, try to use those versions, if still experience the problem please file the issue.

The project will be further reduced for its dependencies.

## How to Build Project

Perform the following steps to be able to build the project.
Be warned that you **should not** call `pod update` as newer version of pod frameworks that Potatso depends on might break building process and there will be errors.

1. `git clone https://github.com/haxpor/Potatso.git` or for faster using less time in cloning `git clone https://github.com/haxpor/Potatso.git --depth=1`
2. `cd Potatso`
3. `git submodule update --init` to update git submodule
4. `pod install` to pull down dependencies into our project
5. Open `Potatso.xcworkspace` then Build and Run the project. Done.

> First two steps are clearly listed here as per [#89](https://github.com/haxpor/Potatso/issues/89); if you download project as zip via Github web interface it will not have enough information to pull down required gitsubmodule, and step 3 will have error. So make sure you clone via command line, or using any git client application before proceeding.
