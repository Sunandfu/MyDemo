# React Meets SwiftUI

I'm looking to learn SwiftUI over the coming weeks and will be using this repository to record various common React design patterns implemented in SwiftUI.

Please note: I'm a total newbie when it comes to Swift, so please contribute where you can to fix my inevitable errors.

### Examples

- [Managing State](State.md)
- [Using Context](Context.md)
- [Using Children](Children.md)
- [Mounting and Unmounting Callbacks](ComponentDidMount.md)
- [Emulating CloneElement](CloneElement.md)
